# AirBnb Analysis with SQL and Pandas

Basic analysis of Airbnb listing data in SQL and Pandas. Data files were read from csv through pandas, and then analyzed with SQL and pandas. Visualizations were created with pandas and matplotlib/seaborn. A local MySQL server was then created to house the data and then connencted with the jupyter notebook to interact with data.

Data was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html 

Dependencies:
1. os
2. mysql.connector
3. pandas
4. numpy
5. matplotlib.pyplot
6. seaborn

IN PROGESS:
This data analysis was very surface level, so further in depth analysis will be done (data distributions, removing outliers, regression). Additionally advanced SQL will be used to JOIN data, use nested queries and UNIONS.
